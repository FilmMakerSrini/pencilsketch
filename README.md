## Pencil Sketch Project

## Project Overview
Pencil Sketch is a web application designed to transform images into pencil sketch renditions using advanced AI techniques. This project leverages the power of Python and Flask for the backend, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, to provide users with an intuitive and seamless experience. Additionally, it utilizes various Azure services to enhance performance, scalability, and monitoring.


## Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for backend logic and AI integration.
Flask: Lightweight WSGI web application framework for building the web server and handling HTTP requests.
HTML: Markup language for structuring the web pages.
CSS: Stylesheet language for designing and layout.
JavaScript: Scripting language for client-side interactivity.
Azure Web App: For deploying and hosting the web application.
Azure Monitor: For monitoring application performance and diagnostics.


## Description
The Pencil Sketch project is designed to provide users with the ability to upload an image and receive a pencil sketch version of that image. This application uses machine learning models to detect edges and apply sketch-like filters, creating a hand-drawn look.

## Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images directly through the web interface.
Sketch Conversion: The backend processes the uploaded images using AI to generate pencil sketches.
Download Option: Users can download the converted pencil sketch images.
Real-Time Processing: Efficient and fast processing of images to provide near real-time results.
Azure Integration: Uses Azure Web App for hosting and Azure Monitor for tracking application performance and health.
